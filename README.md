# Just a simple project on TS

You can create new projects and move them via mouse between active and finished columns.

My target was to work with fundamental TS features and OOP.

It also has a simple validation :
- Min descritiom length - 5 characters
- Min amount of people - 1
- Max amount of people - 10
- All fields are required
